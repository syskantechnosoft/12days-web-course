"In the output of `EXPLAIN`, what does `type: ALL` signify, and is it good or bad for performance?","It signifies a Full Table Scan, which is bad for performance as it means the entire table was read."
"Why is indexing a column with low cardinality, such as 'Gender', generally not useful?",Because the index doesn't filter out enough rows to be efficient; the database still has to read a large portion of the table.
